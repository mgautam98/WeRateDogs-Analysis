# WeRateDogs Analysis

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people’s dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because “they’re good dogs Brent.” WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

In this project, I have wrangled the data from multiple sources and assessed them for the quality and tideness issues and cleanded the data for achieving great visualizations. I will share many insights into the WeRateDogs today. So, stay tuned.
Here, is an example of how WeRateDogs rate the good dogs.
